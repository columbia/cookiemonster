   Install using this: https://deb.nodesource.com/ and try >=v20
2. Install the latest Firebase CLI by running the following in your terminal: `npm install -g firebase-tools`. The version known to work with this README.md is 13.3.0.
3. In your terminal, run `git clone https://github.com/columbia/cookiemonster.git && cd cookiemonster/demo`.
