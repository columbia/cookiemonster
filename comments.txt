1. added pyenv and .python-version to control 3.10.11 usage
2. will need to add setup steps to readme (install pyenv, set poetry use 3.10.11, poetry install)
3. will need to add setup step of copying Criteo_Conversion_Search dataset into the data/criteo folder. might be nice if we automate this.
4. will need to document (if we want to use it) the dataset splitting step.
